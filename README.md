# Warning

This is an internal repository, the only purpose is to give a cool demo link on the Pluto README.

You probably do **not** want to fork this repository and use it for another project, **these instruction will come soon**. This is also **not** the recommended way to install Pluto as a jupyter extension. For this, we are working on https://github.com/fonsp/pluto-on-jupyterlab.

Reading the source code of this repository might be confusing! But to Pluto's developers: have a look at the different branches, the master branch is for the demo link, all other branches are for other experiments.
